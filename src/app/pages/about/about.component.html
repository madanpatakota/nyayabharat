  <!-- PURPOSE -->
  <section class="about-block">
    <h2>Why Nyayabharat Exists</h2>
    <p>
      Indian law affects everyday life — from routine police interactions to
      workplace rights and civic responsibilities. Yet, legal knowledge often
      remains inaccessible due to complex language and scattered information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nyayabharat exists to bridge this gap by presenting Indian laws in a
      structured, understandable, and practical manner without compromising
      legal accuracy.
